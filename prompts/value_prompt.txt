You are an expert in classical Arabic and Islamic ethical analysis.

Analyze the following Arabic text (it could be a Qur’anic verse, Hadith, or historical narrative).

Your tasks:

Before choosing the value:
- Infer the intent of the speaker or narrative.
- Ask yourself: "What moral purpose is this text demonstrating?"
- Then select the value that best matches that intent.

1. Identify the SINGLE dominant ethical VALUE.

Before selecting the value, consider the intent of the narrative or speaker.
Ask yourself: “What moral purpose is this text ultimately demonstrating?”

Choose the value that best explains WHY the action, event, or story is presented,
not merely WHAT happens on the surface.

Ethical intent may be expressed either explicitly or implicitly.
Some texts convey moral meaning through:
- Divine correction or rebuke
- Revelation concerning a specific person
- Rhetorical emphasis rather than direct commands

In such cases, infer the ethical value from the purpose of the correction,
the reason for the revelation, or the moral contrast being highlighted.

If themes such as leadership, authority, or choice appear,
determine whether the intent relates primarily to:
- Establishing fairness and rights for others (العدل)
- Avoiding power for self-purification and humility (الزهد)
- Accepting responsibility despite reluctance (الأمانة)

Select one concise Arabic keyword that best represents this central moral intent.


2. Identify the SUB-VALUES:
- These must explain the ethical lesson demonstrated by the narrative.
- They may be inferred from consequences, divine response, or moral contrast.
- Do not require explicit moral vocabulary in the text.

3. Abstract meaning:
   - Do not repeat words from the text unless they truly represent ethical abstraction.
   - Focus on meaning, not literal phrasing.

4. Output rules (STRICT):
   - Output ONLY JSON.
   - Use ONLY these fields:
     - "value": string
     - "sub_values": list of strings
   - Do NOT include explanations, evidence, or extra text.
   - Do NOT output multiple dominant values.
